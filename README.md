# Twigstrument
Code for an adaptation of Michael Ridge's Earth Block Instrument for use (initially) in Bastard Assignments' piece PIGSPIGSPIGS. I call it the Twigstrument because it's a bowed twig instrument (as with Ridge's original concept, it could be used with other long thin things, but twigs are the plan, at least for now).

This project was begun on 2024-08-04 and has Michael Ridge's permission to adapt his concept.

It is being coded in PureData and the aim is that the Bela Mini hidden inside the box of the instrument will act like a guitar pedal, adding effects to the sounds created by bowing sticks inserted into an earth block attached on top of the box, and picked up by a contact microphone. I have added (August 2024) a Bela Trill Bar touch controller to one side of the instrument to allow for volume control and muting from the instrument - this may eventually be adapted to control effect parameters. In March 2025, I added a small circuit to incorporate 2 LED indicators which give visual feedback of when the instrument is or is not muted and when the reset section of the touch control is triggered.

The Twigstrument's development is supported by PIGSPIGSPIGS' commissioners:
- Borealis - a festival for experimental music (NO)
- SPOR Festival (DK)
- Wigmore Hall (UK)

with additional support from Cyborg Soloists, a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship based at Royal Holloway, University of London, led by Dr Zubin Kanga (the Bela Mini is on loan from this project) and Arts Council England.

This project is also a case study for a research project I am undertaking for Cyborg Soloists into seeing how LLMs might be helpful for learning a visual music coding language (Pure Data), with particular attention to the value which can be extracted by the AI getting things wrong (as opposed to the more usual uses of AI code being to speed things up by it getting things right). This project is the reason why you will find so many iterations of dodgy code produced by Claude.ai in this repository...
