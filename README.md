Code for an adaptation of Michael Ridge's Earth Block Instrument for Bastard Assignments' piece PIGSPIGSPIGS

This project was begun on 2024-08-04 and has Michael Ridge's permission to adapt his concept.

It is being coded in PureData and the aim is that the Bela Mini hidden inside the box of the instrument will act like a guitar pedal, adding effects to the sounds created by bowing sticks inserted into an earth block attached on top of the box, and picked up by a contact microphone.
